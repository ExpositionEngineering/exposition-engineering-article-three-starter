## üèÅ Introduction

This project invites you to use exposition engineering tools (e.g., VS Code and
artificial intelligence writing assistants) to write your own an article of
between three and four pages on **the future of the podcasting industry**. In
addition to writing all of the required content in the file
[writing/article.md](writing/article.md), you will continue to use `git` and
GitHub and check the writing in a Markdown file through the use of tools like
the [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs
the automated grading checks provided by
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader). This assignment is
a follow-on from your last exposition engineering article, with the exception
of the fact that the last article required you to exclusively leverage an AI
writing assistant to complete the project and this one only permits you to use
the AI writing assistant in, at most, a supporting and documented role.

Please note that the content provided in the `README.md` file for this GitHub
repository is an overview of the project and thus may not include the details
for every step needed to successfully complete every project deliverable. This
means that you will need to work on the assignment during class and that you
may need to schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours to
discuss aspects of this project. Finally, it is important to point out that
your repository for this project was created from the GitHub repository
template called
[exposition-engineering-article-three-starter](https://github.com/ExpositionEngineering/exposition-engineering-article-three-starter);
you can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation
or source code!

## ü§ù Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as an exposition engineer is to search for and then
understand and ultimately apply the technical writing content found in
additional resources. For instance, you may need to seek assistance from the
course instructor and/or review additional resources about how to use the
GitHub footnotes standard 

## üõ´ Project Overview

This assignment invites you to use exposition engineering tools to complete an
article of between three and four pages on **the future of the podcasting
industry**. Please note that, unlike the prior writing assignment on the same
topic, this assignment asks that you write the article by yourself and only use
exposition engineering tools (e.g., AI writing assistants) in a support role.
Bearing in mind this point, please also don't forget that, if you use any type
of exposition engineering tool, you need to cite it and describe your use of it
in the tool section of your article. In addition to meeting all of the baseline
requirements that are enforced through automated checks run in GitHub Actions,
your article must have all of the following components that are exclusively
written by you, the human author of the exposition engineering article:

- **Title and Theme**: The article should establish a viewpoint on a theme
within the specified topic for this article. The viewpoint for the article
should be reflected in a clear and compelling title that highlights the purpose
of the article.

- **Introduction Section**: The article should contain an introduction section
that establishes the audience for the article, clearly states its viewpoint,
and provides a brief overview of the claims that it will make.

- **Body Sections**: The article should contain multiple body sections that
make self-contained points while featuring clear transitions between the main
topics. Whenever possible, the content in the body sections should contain
claims backed up by in-text citations to articles in the references section.

- **Conclusion Section**: The article should contain a conclusion section that
reiterates the article's viewpoint and provides a summary of the main claims.

- **References Section**: The article should contain a references section
comprised of at least five references to reputable sources that are cited in
the introduction, main body, and/or conclusion sections of the article. All of
these references should use the [GitHub footnotes
standard](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes).
Each reference must contain all of the bibliographic details for each source
and a credibility statement that explains why the author deems the source to be
an authoritative one that can credibly advance the article's argument. Please
note that your article must feature in-text citations to the specific references
that appear inside of the references section of your article.

The completion of this assignment will take place over two weeks and follow
this schedule:

- **Week One, Class One**: Develop an idea for the article within the stated
theme and gather sources that will support the claims made in the article.

- **Week One, Class Two**: Using the sources and the main idea for the article,
create a complete outline for it that includes a list of sections and the bullet
points for the key claims that each section will make. Please note that the
bullet points for the key claims should appear as comments inside of the article
itself, exactly as you did for your first article assignment.

- **Week Two, Class One**: Write a complete draft of the article that includes
all of the sections with content that makes the stated claims and supports them
with in-text citations to the article's references. Using GitHub's pull request
and/or issue tracking features, complete a peer review of the outline for one
class member's article and receive feedback on your article from one member of
the class.

- **Week Two, Class Two**: Using the feedback from the peer review and
additional writing and revision effort on your part, complete a final version of
the article that you will submit by 11:59 PM on Friday of the second week.

## üêä Project Assessment

The course instructor will assess this article with the support of the following
criteria established by the faculty members who assess writing assignments
submitted as a part of the First-Year/Sophomore writing and speaking program:

- **Audience**: Awareness of an intended audience that fuels the article's
delivery of ideas that are relevant to and suitable for that audience;
- **Purpose**: Communication of purpose that is relevant to an audience and an
occasion that is customized by the author and tailored to the article's
purpose;
- **Organization**: Employment of effective organization patterns and
techniques that signpost for the reader the article's structure and the
relationships among its key ideas;
- **Sources**: Use of high-quality, credible, and relevant sources that support
the development of the article's main claims;
- **Context**: Articulates a claim in a complex and nuanced fashion that
accounts for different contexts and assumptions.

Please see the course instructor for more details about the assessment rubric in
use to assess each of these categories. With that said, for each of the above
categories, the course instructor will use concrete evidence extracted for your
exposition engineering article to classify it into one of the following levels:

- **Not Evident**: The article does not demonstrate evidence for the criterion.
- **Developing**: The article demonstrates some evidence for the criterion.
- **Proficient**: The article demonstrates a proficient level for the criterion.
- **Exemplary**: The article demonstrates an exemplary level for the criterion.

Importantly, students who chose to revise their article beyond the stated
deadline may "pay" an exposition engineering token to regain access to their
GitHub repository and then revise the article again, as outline in the course
syllabus. Finally, please keep in mind the following reminders as you consider
how the course instructor will assess whether or not the final version of your
project meets additional baseline requirements related to, for instance, the
correct use of Markdown features like sections and footnotes:

- If you have already installed the
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs the
automated grading checks provided by
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) you can, from the
repository's base directory, run the automated grading checks by typing
`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`.
- You may also review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions.
Please note that if all of the GatorGrader checks do not pass, then your GitHub
Actions build will not pass either. You need to make sure that you have a
passing build in GitHub Actions before the project's due date.
- The GitHub repository that houses this project has a GitHub Actions
configuration that will report to you through the GitHub Actions tab a summary
of the key results from running the assessment. You can check this tab to
quickly see which the status of the GatorGrader checks and to review a report
about the coverage of the test suite that accompanies the project.
- Don't forget that you must provide all of the required responses to the
technical writing prompts in the `writing/article.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
labels from all of the provided source code and technical writing. This means
that instead of only deleting and/or rewriting the `TODO` marker from the file
you should delete the `TODO` marker and the entire prompt and then add your own
content to demonstrate that you understand all aspects of this project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Effective Exposition Engineering

Students who create the any type of writing, speaking, or peer review should
ensure the creation of a high-quality final product. While students are
permitted to use a wide variety of exposition engineering tools, such as grammar
checkers, idea generators, text writers, and text revisers, including
intelligent systems that leverage large language models like GitHub Copilot or
ChatGPT, they must take responsibility for all of the content that they submit
for this course, including artifacts that are automatically generated, enhanced,
or reviewed by a software tool. Any student who uses exposition engineering
tool(s) should also include a statement at the end of their article that clearly
explains their chosen tools and workflows. Students should provide a list
containing each tool that they used and then a statement of how this tool works
and the ways in which they leveraged this tool when completing the assignment.

Students who use software tools to create content are responsible for citing the
source of the software tool and demonstrating their understanding of it during
any in-person discussions that take place during a class session or a meeting
during office hours. Moreover, all students in the class are responsible for all
of the written documentation submitted to the GitHub repository that hosts the
course projects, including any tool-generated written artifacts. This means that
every student should be able to answer questions, during either an in-person or
online discussion, about any technical or professional content, including that
which was automatically generated by a software tool.

Students who are effective exposition engineers also pledge to abide by the [ACM
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).
Unless the students in this course furnish a different governing contract, they
also pledge to follow the principles espoused by exemplary technical
organizations, such as [Oxide Computer](https://oxide.computer/) and its public
statement of [mission and principles](https://oxide.computer/principles).
Students who are not sure how to abide by the principles of effective exposition
engineering should schedule a meeting with the course instructor during office
hours in order to make sure that they enhance their understanding and abide by
these requirements for this article.
